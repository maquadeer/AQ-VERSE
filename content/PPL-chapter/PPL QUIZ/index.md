<details>
  <summary>Language Evaluation Criteria</summary>

  <details>
    <summary>Readability</summary>

    1. Software development was largely thought of in terms of writing code (LOC).
    2. Language constructs designed more from the point of view of computers than users.
    3. Readability became crucial for ease of maintenance.
    4. Shift from machine orientation to human orientation.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Overall Simplicity</summary>

    - Too many features make the language difficult to learn.
    - Multiplicity of features complicates the language.
    - Example: Java has multiple ways to increment a variable.
    - Operator overloading can reduce readability if not used sensibly.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Orthogonality</summary>

    1. Makes the language easy to learn and read.
    2. Meaning is context-independent.
    3. A relatively small set of primitive constructs can be combined in a relatively small number of ways.
    4. Every possible combination is legal and meaningful.
    5. ALGOL 68 is an example of highly orthogonal design.
    6. However, excessive orthogonality can lead to unnecessary complexity.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Control Statements</summary>

    - Indiscriminate use of goto statements reduced program readability.
    - Example: Nested loops in C.
    - Control statement design is now less important for readability than in the past.
  </details>

  <details>

  </details>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Writability</summary>

  <details>
    <summary>Simplicity and Orthogonality</summary>

    - A smaller number of primitive constructs with consistent rules is better.
    - Support for abstraction allows ignoring details in complicated structures or operations.
    - Process abstraction is using a subprogram to implement a task instead of replicating it.
    - Expressivity means having convenient ways of specifying computations.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Reliability</summary>

    - A program is reliable if it performs to specifications under all conditions.
    - Type checking detects type errors, enhancing reliability.

<summary>7th answer</summary>
<details>
  <summary>De-notational Semantics</summary>

  - Based on recursive function theory, the most abstract semantics description method.
  - Originally developed by Scott and Strachey.

  <details>
    <summary>The Process of Building a De-notational Specification</summary>

    1. Define a mathematical object for each language entity.
    2. Define a function that maps instances of language entities onto instances of corresponding mathematical objects.
  </details>

  - The meaning of language constructs is defined by the values of the program's variables.
  - Difference between denotational and operational semantics: In operational semantics, state changes are defined by coded algorithms; in denotational semantics, they are defined by rigorous mathematical functions.

  <details>
    <summary>State of a Program</summary>

    - The state of a program is the values of all its current variables, represented as `s = {<i1, v1>, <i2, v2>, ..., <in, vn>}`.
    - `VARMAP` is a function that, given a variable name and a state, returns the current value of the variable: `VARMAP (ij, s) = vj`.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Decimal Numbers</summary>

    - `<dec_num>` can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 or `<dec_num>` followed by (0, 1, 2, ..., 9).
    - `Mdec` functions map decimal numbers to their corresponding values.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Expressions</summary>

    - `Me(<expr>, s)` evaluates expressions based on their types:
      - `<dec_num>`: `Mdec(<dec_num>, s)`
      - `<var>`: `VARMAP(<var>, s)`
      - `<binary_expr>`: Operates based on the operator.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Assignment Statements</summary>

    - `Ma(x := E, s)` assigns the value of expression `E` to variable `x` in state `s`.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Logical Pretest Loops</summary>

    - `Ml(while B do L, s)` represents the meaning of a pretest loop.
    - The loop is converted from iteration to recursion, mathematically defined by recursive state mapping functions.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Evaluation of De-notational Semantics</summary>

    - Can be used to prove the correctness of programs.
    - Provides a rigorous way to think about programs.
    - Can aid in language design.
    - Used in compiler generation systems.
  </details>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Axiomatic Semantics</summary>

  - Based on formal logic (first-order predicate calculus).
  - Original purpose: formal program verification.
  - Approach: Define axioms or inference rules for each statement type in the language.
  - Expressions are called assertions.
  - An assertion before a statement (precondition) states relationships and constraints among variables.
  - An assertion after a statement is a postcondition.
  - Weakest precondition is the least restrictive precondition guaranteeing the postcondition.

  <details>
    <summary>Pre-Post Form: {P} statement {Q}</summary>

    - Example: `a := b + 1 {a > 1}`.
    - One possible precondition: `{b > 10}`.
    - Weakest precondition: `{b > 0}`.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Program Proof Process</summary>

    - Postcondition for the whole program is the desired result.
    - Work back through the program to the first statement.
    - If the precondition on the first statement matches the program spec, the program is correct.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Inference Rule for Logical Pretest Loops</summary>

    - For the loop construct: `{P} while B do S end {Q}`.
    - Inference rule involves a loop invariant (I).
    - Characteristics of the loop invariant:
      - `P => I` (initially true).
      - `{I} B {I}` (Boolean evaluation does not change the validity of I).
      - `{I and B} S {I}` (I is not changed by executing the loop body).
      - `(I and (not B)) => Q` (if I is true and B is false, Q is implied).
      - Loop termination (can be difficult to prove).
      - I is a weakened version of the loop postcondition and also a precondition.
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Evaluation of Axiomatic Semantics</summary>

    - Developing axioms or inference rules for all statements in a language is challenging.
    - Good for correctness proofs and an excellent framework for reasoning about programs.
    - Not as useful for language users and compiler writers.
  </details>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Attribute Grammar Attributes</summary>

  - `actual_type`: synthesized for `<var>` and `<expr>`
  - `expected_type`: inherited for `<expr>`
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How are attribute values computed?</summary>

  1. If all attributes were inherited, the tree could be decorated in top-down order.
  2. If all attributes were synthesized, the tree could be decorated in bottom-up order.
  3. In many cases, both kinds of attributes are used, and it is some combination of top-down and bottom-up that must be used.

  <details>
    <summary>Attribute Dependencies</summary>

    - `<expr>.env` inherited from parent
    - `<expr>.expected_type` inherited from parent
    - `<var>[1].env` depends on `<expr>.env`
    - `<var>[2].env` depends on `<expr>.env`
    - `<var>[1].actual_type`: `lookup(A, <var>[1].env)`
    - `<var>[2].actual_type`: `lookup(B, <var>[2].env)`
    - `<var>[1].actual_type =? <var>[2].actual_type`
    - `<expr>.actual_type`: `<var>[1].actual_type`
    - `<expr>.actual_type =? <expr>.expected_type`

<summary>Difference</summary>
Certainly! Here's a table differentiating between a compiler and an interpreter:

| Feature                | Compiler                                           | Interpreter                                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Translation**        | Translates the entire source code before execution | Translates line by line or statement by statement during execution |
| **Execution Speed**    | Generally produces faster machine code for execution | Generally slower as it interprets code at runtime   |
| **Output**             | Generates an intermediate machine code or executable file | No separate executable file; interprets code directly |
| **Errors**             | All errors are reported after the entire code is translated | Stops at the first encountered error, reports it, and halts execution |
| **Memory Usage**       | Generally requires more memory during compilation   | Typically uses less memory during interpretation   |
| **Platform Dependency**| Generates platform-specific machine code              | More portable as it interprets source code directly  |
| **Debugging**          | May be more challenging due to the generated machine code | Easier to debug as errors are reported line by line  |
| **Examples**           | C, C++, Java                                       | Python, JavaScript, Ruby                          |

<details>
<summary>Aliasing</summary>
# Aliasing in Programming

- **Definition:** Aliasing occurs when two or more different names or references are used to access the same memory location or variable.

- **Consequence:** Changes made through one identifier can affect the data accessed through another identifier.

- **Common in Pointers/References:** Aliasing is often associated with languages that allow direct memory manipulation, such as C or C++, especially when using pointers or references.

- **Example:** If two pointers point to the same memory location, modifications through one pointer will be reflected when accessing the data through the other pointer.

- **Side Effects:** Aliasing can lead to unintended side effects and make code more error-prone, as the program may not behave as expected due to shared data.

- **Management:** Careful management or avoidance of aliasing is crucial for writing robust and predictable code, particularly in situations where pointers or references are extensively used.

- **Language-Specific Approaches:** Some programming languages, like Java, implement mechanisms to minimize or prevent aliasing, contributing to increased code safety.
