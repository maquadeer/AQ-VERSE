<summary> 1st Answer</summary> 
## Reasons for Studying Concepts of Programming Languages

## Increased Ability to Express Ideas

- Depth of thought influenced by language expressiveness.
- Difficulty conceptualizing structures without descriptive language.
- Limits on control structures, data structures, and abstractions based on the development language.
- Awareness of a variety of language features reduces limitations in software development.
- Exploration of language constructs and their simulation in languages lacking direct support.

## Improved Background for Choosing Appropriate Languages

- Programmers tend to favor familiar languages, even if unsuitable for new projects.
- Familiarity with a range of languages empowers informed language selection.

## Greater Ability to Learn New Languages

- Continuous evolution of programming languages necessitates ongoing learning.
- Understanding object-oriented programming facilitates learning languages like Java.
- Thorough comprehension of fundamental language concepts eases adaptation to new languages.

## Understand Significance of Implementation

- Insight into implementation issues illuminates the design rationale of languages.
- Enables intelligent use of a language according to its intended design.

## Ability to Design New Languages

- Knowledge of multiple languages enhances understanding of programming language concepts.
- Proficiency in designing new languages based on comprehensive knowledge.

## Overall Advancement of Computing

- Instances where language popularity did not align with conceptual superiority.
- Historical example: ALGOL 60 vs. Fortran, possibly influenced by lack of understanding of ALGOL 60's conceptual design.
- Consideration of external factors, such as IBM's role.

# Programming Domains

## Scientific Applications

- Invention of computers in the 40s for scientific applications.
- Requirement for large-scale floating-point computations.
- Fortran as the first language developed for scientific applications.
- ALGOL 60 intended for similar use.

## Business Applications

- COBOL as the first successful language for business applications.
- Emphasis on report generation, decimal arithmetic, and character manipulation.
- Arrival of PCs led to new ways for businesses to use computers.
- Development of spreadsheets and database systems for business applications.

## Artificial Intelligence

- Symbolic computations in AI, favoring linked lists over arrays.
- LISP as the first widely used AI programming language.

## Systems Programming

- O/S and programming support tools collectively known as system software.
- Efficiency crucial due to continuous use.

## Scripting Languages

- Scripting involves putting a list of commands (script) in a file for execution.
- Example: PHP, a scripting language used on web server systems.
- Code embedded in HTML documents, interpreted on the server before sending to the requesting browser.
